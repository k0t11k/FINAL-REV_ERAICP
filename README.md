TP Tickets Partner (RV.RA-ICP)

Overview

TP Tickets Partner, branded as RV.RA-ICP, is a decentralized platform for creating events and selling tickets, leveraging the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) blockchain for secure, transparent, and fraud-proof transactions. The platform allows users to purchase tickets for concerts, theaters, sports, festivals, and other events, primarily in Kyiv, Ukraine, with plans for broader expansion. Tickets are issued as NFTs, ensuring uniqueness and authenticity, and are accessible via QR codes for seamless entry. The platform supports a Telegram web application (@TP_TicketsPartner_bot) for convenient access without installation and has now expanded to a fully functional website.

Installation

To run the TP Tickets Partner website locally, follow these steps:





Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/tp-tickets-partner.git
cd tp-tickets-partner



Serve the Website: Since the website is a static single-page application, you can serve it using any static file server. For example, using http-server:

npm install -g http-server
http-server .

Alternatively, you can open index.html directly in a browser for basic functionality, but a server is recommended for proper asset loading.

React and ReactDOM: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/18.2.0/umd/react.production.min.js

Tailwind CSS: https://cdn.tailwindcss.com



Google Fonts (Poppins): https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins

No additional installation is required for these dependencies as they are loaded at runtime.
